This is a flashbang script that was scripted for FiveM. Basically you just throw it and wherever it explosed it causes any player near it to collapse with some screen effects.

# Known Bugs
1. Weapon is named Tear Gas (I don't know metas well enough to fix it)
2. Weapon has smoke on it when thrown (It is another part that I have no idea how to fix)
3. Weapon has a timer to hold it (No idea how to fix that either)
