# Flashbang
This is a reworked version of the flashbang script.

# Credits
* Scripted By: Xander1998 (X. Cross)
* Model Ported & META's redone By: xRxExTxRxOx
* Forked And Edited By: Eddie (Eddbox LP)

# Changelog
1. Explosion now checks for line of sight towards players face to trigger effects.
2. Beeing too close to the explosion causes damage to the player.
3. Effects now stack properly when flashed multiple times. That means severity and stun times increase with each hit.
4. Effect strength and duration is dynamically scaled by distance.
5. Added config options to facilitate changes.

# Known Bugs
* Weapon has smoke on it when thrown (It is another part that I have no idea how to fix)
* Weapon has a timer to hold it (No idea how to fix that either)
